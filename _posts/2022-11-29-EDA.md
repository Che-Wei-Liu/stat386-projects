# Introduction
<br>
In my last post of scraping and cleaning the data from the IMDb website, I introduced ways to collect desired variables and put them together as a dataframe from html code. However, that's just data collecting; not even the beginning of a real data analysis. <br><br>In this post, I am going to analyze the dataframe I gather last time using several different charts in seaborn. We will see what insteresting or suprising things we can find.
